# COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-Ray Images Using CNN
Description:
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The model is trained to differentiate between COVID-19 positive, normal, and pneumonia images. The repository includes the dataset, the notebook for model training and evaluation, and instructions for running the code. This tool aims to assist in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 from medical imaging data.
